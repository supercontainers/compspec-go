# Comspec in Go

![img/compspec.png](img/compspec.png)

This is a prototype compatibility checking tool. Right now our aim is to use in the context of
[these build matrices](https://github.com/rse-ops/lammps-matrix) for LAMMPS and these prototype [specifications](https://github.com/supercontainers/compspec) that are based off of [Proposal C](https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-image-compatibility/pull/8) of the Compatibility Working Group. This is experimental because all of that is subject (and likely) to change. This project is under development, and you can see our [docs](docs) for early documentation.

### Limitations

 - I'm starting with just Linux. I know there are those "other" platforms, but if it doesn't run on HPC or Kubernetes easily I'm not super interested (ahem, Mac and Windows)!
 - not all extractors work in containers (e.g., kernel needs to be on the host)
 - The node feature discovery source doesn't provide mapping of socket -> cores, nor does it give details about logical vs. physical CPU.
  - We will likely want to add hwloc go bindings, but there is a bug currently. 

Note that for development we are using nfd-source that does not require kubernetes:

```bash
go get -u github.com/converged-computing/nfd-source/source@0.0.1
# first one
go get -u github.com/researchapps/go-hwloc@5dbf06a64b468bb4fcec633a12b8e268aacce511

# second one
go get -u github.com/researchapps/go-hwloc@41f6840ad032fa5000bddacacecaeec65d9768c1 
```

There is some bug with installing the traditional way that I can look into later:

```
github.com/compspec/compspec-go/plugins/extractors/nfd imports
        github.com/converged-computing/nfd-source/source: no matching versions for query "latest"
```

And moving forward we will be working from this WIP branch:

```bash
# This is the develop branch
go get -u github.com/converged-computing/nfd-source/source@20d686e64926b80421637e82fb68e6c5f3f9242a
```

Note that the above is the main branch on February 22, 2024!

## TODO

 - add descriptions to sections
 - make extractor sections into interface
 - metadata namespace and exposure: someone writing a spec to create an artifact needs to know the extract namespace (and what is available) for the mapping.
 - tests: matrix that has several different flavors of builds, generating compspec json output to validate generation and correctness
 - likely we want a common configuration file to take an extraction -> check recipe
 - todo thinking around manifest.yaml that has listing of images / artifacts

### Extractors wanted / needed
